# PRiSMFLUX' personal homepage

This is the repo which hosts my personal homepage. Everything here is static and only runs in the client browser.

## Features
* Create new pages (or posts) with Markdown
* Really cool opening animation
* Dynamic Header Build controllable with a JSON file (see [elements.json](elements.json))
* Open-Source! (I mean, you're browsing its repo right now)
* Hyperlinking via HTML-Hashes in Markdown to get a seemless browsing experience
* Optimizations for smartphones (testing is done on an iPhone 11 Pro btw)
* NO trackers are being used (Cookies are used to store the state of the animation, so it doesnt get annoying after few page visits)
* Recognizes System-wide Dark Mode setting (only works on supported browsers)

(Check out all Features in the [md/CHANGELOG.md](md/CHANGELOG.md) of look at the end of the page)

## Bugs
* You tell me ;)
