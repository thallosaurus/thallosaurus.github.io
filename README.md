# PRiSMFLUX' personal homepage

This is the repo which hosts my personal homepage. Everything here is static and only runs in the client browser.

## Features
* Create new pages (or posts) with Markdown
* Really cool opening animation
* Dynamic Header Build controllable with a JSON file (see [elements.json](elements.json))
* Open-Source! (I mean, you're browsing its repo right now)
* Hyperlinking via HTML-Hashes in Markdown to get a seemless browsing experience
* Optimizations for smartphones (testing is done on an iPhone 11 Pro btw)
* NO trackers or cookies are being used

## Bugs
* You tell me ;)
