# Equipment

A little over a year ago I switched my musical workflow to hardware synthesizers and oh my was it an improvment. You know, you sit in front of a PC all the time because of your job, you have to deal with bugs and glitches all day and when you come home, you really don't wanna see a PC again until the next day. So, I decided to build myself a small hardware-only synthesizer setup. And because I'm a huge music production nerd I list my whole equipment here, not just my hardware:

(DISCLAIMER: I don't advertise anything here. The following text reflects my own opinion on these products. I bought all of this from my own money and I don't get get any money to say this)

## Hardware

* Denon DJ MCX8000 - A nice DJ controller. Can be used with Serato, with digital vinyls and also standalone. It just sucks that my standalone mode is broken and Serato is acting really really buggy lately... (if you know a fix, please DM me on Instagram: @djprismflux)
* Behringer NEUTRON - Great little box, Can't recommend it enough! With it's huge patchbay area it's almost a gateway drug into modular synthesizers. Good thing, my bank account has some kind of protection enabled! :D
* Behringer TD-3-SR - The sweet, sweet sounds of acid in my ears. Never owned an original 303 but it sounds almost identical to the Roland OG. It's kind of a no brainer regarding its price. (I mean, duh, 150â‚¬ for the near identical sound of a 303?)
* Behringer RD8 - My first drum machine, drums like an 808 beast! Brings me joy everytime I use it.
* Elektron Model:Samples - My first sample-player/groovebox. It's capable of so many things (of which I haven't discovered all lol) and I would perform live with it. With it's 6 tracks, you already got enough for a simple banger but thanks to sample locks, you can also use the blank spaces in your tracks to cram even more action into your tracks!
* Arturia BeatStep Pro - my first sequencer
* Arturia KeyStep
* IK Multimedia UNO Synth - My very first synth I ever bought. It is alright but in my setup it's either too quiet or with distortion enabled everything kinda sounds squishy and powerless. An okay-ish synth
* Behringer XENYX Q802USB - Got this mixer when my internal soundcard got fried. It's actually a nice mixer but it sucks that you only get one stereo signal. The oldest part of my setup (7 years old)
* Launchpad mini MK2 - It's just an array of mappable buttons but it works. Also good if you wanna learn fingerdrumming or just wanna play clips from Ableton

## Software

* FL Studio 20 - A loyal friend, always there when you need it. Easy to use, easy to learn and with so many possibilities. You can also create visualizer videos for YouTube right inside it. Comes with a massive stock plugin selection. Also can handle VSTs well, but unfortunately does crash sometimes
* Ableton Live 10 - A good friend. Runs rock solid and the workflow is better for hardware. Can also be used without hardware and still feels really good to use.
* Serato DJ Pro - Used to be a very nice piece of software but turned into a buggy mess which doesn't load new tracks properly and if it does, it blocks the other deck from buffering. Really annoying... Also prevents me from completly switching to Linux, because Wines MIDI doesn't work with Serato.
