# My Music

(If you just wanna see what equipment I use [click here](#equipment) to skip the wall of text ahead)

## Production

I started making music when I was around 13. It all started when I found a program called FL Studio and saw, they have a demo available. Because I was thinking about how music is made (and once I reached the limits of Audacity) I installed FL and just played around without knowing anything what the hell I'm doing there. You can imagine how shitty it sounded but once I got the hang of it, I trained and became better and better.

As the years passed, I have gained so much knowledge about music production, either by just clicking around or by reading and watching tutorials. I didn't even think that music would stick to myself, because every hobby I started began to fade away very quickly.

## DJing

When I was around 14, I got myself a small Hercules DJ Controller for like 100 bucks. It was more like the mere basics (3 Band EQ, 2 Decks, Looper, nothing else) but it was this toycontroller where I gained the basics of DJing. I started out with Hardstyle, which I recommend every beginner. Use the Original Mixes of the tracks, because most of them start with a 32 bar intro and end with a 32 bar outro (if I recall correctly). With this, you can learn some basic transitions and get used to playing music seamlessly. But when I got older, I got more and more into the metalscene, which is not that easy to DJ with (It could work but I really don't see, how). So I paused the DJing and got myself a Guitar.

## My adventure into Metal

A good friend of mine had a Guitar he didn't like and he just wanted to get rid of it. Thanks to him, I wanted one too, so I "adopted" his unwanted guitar and now, I had a new mission. Learn the guitar. Fast. Now. (I didn't, oops). Of course, I tried to make metal music with this guitar and I also recorded some tracks of low quality, because mixing and mastering metal is very different from mixing techno or electronic stuff. Since I also didn't want to spend a fortune on equipment (I was 15/16 at that time and was still a student) I settled with this quality, also because of lack of guitar skills. After some 4 years or so, I gave my guitar and bass guitar to a friend who really wanted to learn guitar because he got more time on his hands than me (and also probably more motivation than me). Keep in mind that E-Guitars are kinda like a Boomerang. You give one away and some time later you see yourself in your room with a new guitar. Dangit.

## Coming back to DJing

After some new adventures into other music genres and because of my declining interest in metal but uprising interest in Techno, I decided to search my old Hercules Controller. (Spoiler: Those things really have a good build quality, dont ask) and I was amazed it still worked perfectly. So, I downloaded some techno tracks, got some cheap monitor earphones and tried to relive my DJ skills. I really was shocked that I still had those skills engraved into me, because there was little to no change between Techno and Hardstyle. So I played around and because I got into streaming some time after, I tried to DJ on Facebook Live for my friends. A good friend of mine saw one of those streams and got an Idea... So, around 2019, this friend messaged me if I had interest in some equipment. Since I'm a poor sucker with a passion, I instinctively said "yes!". After negotiation on the price, he brought me a nice used Denon DJ MCX8000 "Standalone" Controller. And OMG, I was in love. I streamed and streamed and I got better with time and it was awesome. I gained some friends through some raves and they told me, if I wanted, I can play live once or twice. And gosh was it awesome.

## The Hardware Saga

Because I was astonished by music hardware, I searched for a job. I wanted to have a room full with things that make (awful) noises. So I got myself 3 Synthesizers, one Sampler, a Drummachine and a MIDI Keyboard and Sequencer. If you're interested in my current equipment, [click here](#equipment). And I noticed a significant positive shift in my personal music skills and also in my creativity, I quickyl fell in love, again. (I'm a little b'tch, sorrryyyyyyy). I mostly stream now some hardware jams and sometimes also a DJ set.
