# About Me

I've worked on several projects of which a few are still online.

## Projects
* [liesmich](https://liesmich.herokuapp.com) - small demo of a location based social network
* [PRiSMFLUX](https://prismflux.de) - the page you're on
* [JSSequencer-node](https://github.com/thallosaurus/jssequencer-node) - a MIDI Sequencer you can control over a website. Provides a Step Sequencer and MIDI-Clock over USB
* Several other projects I can't talk about publicly
