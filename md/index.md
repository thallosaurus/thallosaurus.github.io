# Hello!

Welcome to my page! Right now, there is no real content but it'll follow, I promise!

## Who are you?
My name is Philipp Ga√üner and I live in Bavaria, Germany. I'm currently in training to become a software engineer. I love making music because it allows me to express myself. Read more about it [here](?p=music).

Languages/Skills I know and can handle fine:
* JavaScript
* Java
* PHP
* Server Side JavaScript (Node.JS)

More stuff will follow soon!
