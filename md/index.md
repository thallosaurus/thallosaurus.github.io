# Hello!

Welcome to my page! Right now, there is no real content but it'll follow, I promise!

## Who are you?
My name is Philipp Ga√üner and I live in Bavaria, Germany. I'm currently in training to become a software engineer. I love making music because it allows me to express myself. Read more about it [here](#music).

Languages/Skills I know and can handle fine:
* JavaScript
* Java
* PHP
* Server Side JavaScript (Node.JS)

# Is there a way to support you?
Yes, there is! You can buy my tracks anywhere you can get music digitally or [Support me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/prismflux). Also, be sure to subscribe to my YouTube Channel so you don't miss any future tracks or streams I do :)
